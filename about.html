        <h1>PROFESSIONAL HISTORY</h1>
        <p>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the summers of 2016 and 2017, I worked at McKinsey and Company in New York as an intern in the IT department. My activities there included: evaluation of technical solutions, coordination of test groups, data synthesis and visualization, and product prototyping. More recently, I have been working with agile teams to explore the ways in which technology can help its users live richer lives.

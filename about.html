        <h1>PROFESSIONAL HISTORY</h1>
        <p>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhile I was in high school, I served as a part-time technology advisor for LBG Real Estate, a small commercial real estate firm based in Los Angeles. My role involved maintaining that firm's workstations. At that time, I also served as a teaching assistant for the computer science teacher at my high school. I taught the fundamentals of programing and computer science to my peers. In the summers of 2016 and 2017, I worked at McKinsey and Company in New York as an intern in the IT department. My activities there included: evaluation of technical solutions, coordination of test groups, data synthesis and visualization, and product prototyping.
